# Assignment 11 – Image Classification with Random Forest and SVM

This project classifies images from the CIFAR-10 dataset using two traditional machine learning models:

- ✅ **Random Forest** (with GridSearchCV for tuning)
- ✅ **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

## Dataset
- CIFAR-10: 60,000 color images (32x32) in 10 classes
- Preprocessing: normalization + flattening into 3072-length feature vectors

## Evaluation
- Random Forest Accuracy: ~37.7%
- SVM Accuracy: ~44.4%
- Classification reports and confusion matrices included
- New image tested with prediction output

## Files
- `Assignment11_Image_Classification.ipynb`: Main notebook
- `converted_image.jpg`: Example image used for prediction
- `Report.pdf`: Summary of the entire project and results

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Follow each section in order
3. Upload your own image and test the model!
